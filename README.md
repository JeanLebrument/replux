> Self contained components and enhancements for [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux)

## Background

As a project grows there's increased need for a library to handle its application architecture.  In React the main design pattern to accomplish this is [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/)(check it out for a more detailed explanation).  Facebook has a library build around this design pattern, but its pretty minimal.  Personally I think it doesn't provide the utility needed to build a react application quickly, clean, and maintainable.  Luckily there are many other libraries that do a much better job.  I spent some time looking over the many libraries available, and landed on [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) as the best library to solve my needs.
